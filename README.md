# Xively-Viewer

I am a big fan of Xively (before that Cosm). I have blogged about in [several][weatherstation] [occasions][pijs-tuto].

Unfortunately when they switched their name and went from Cosm to Xively, they forgot something extremely important for me: the ability to see more than the last six hours of data. Thankfully they have a [great JS  API][xively-api] and I built this simple viewer to watch how my data evolved over time.

This project is released under the MIT open-source license. Do what you want with it. 

Lots of credits go to Jason Neylon who [had the same problem][jason] and found most of what was needed to make this happen. I have just made it more generic.
